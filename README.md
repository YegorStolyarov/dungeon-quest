# Dungeon Quest
Updated version of funny game which I failed to build from original repo.
Runs on bevy=0.11

Doing it for learning purposes.

Main problem is that AppState stack was removed, and now there is single State.
So Pause mechanics was refactored dramatically, same as Rewards screen for survival mode.

Feel free to create issues or PR if you want.

```cargo run``` for build and play.
